# Third-Person Parkour and Traversal System

- Programmed a third-person controller in Unity using C# for dynamic parkour actions such as running, jumping, and climbing.
- Utilized Unity's CharacterController component to handle player movement and collision detection.
- Used raycasting and trigger colliders to detect and interact with environmental elements, enabling the character to perform parkour manoeuvres.
